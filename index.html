My cause is driven “I love my brothers” this is a phrase I use quite often. This phrase means  I love the men in my life whom I consider family. I have a twin brother, but I have a lot more brothers as well. I have been through a lot during my college career and men in my life have helped me through that. When I utter this phrase on Centre’s campus it is usually directed at my fraternity brothers, or my Brothers in Christ. These two groups are quite different, but the support I have received from them has given me the strength to complete the difficult tasks life put s in from of me. One reason I want to do well  because my peers have invested time and effort into my development, and I cannot let them down. One misconception people have about my cause is that fraternity men do negatively impact academics. I do not believe this is true, as my fraternity brothers have been a huge support to me in my academic career. I have had brothers force me to study for exams and force me to go to class even when I didn’t want to. I would convince someone that fraternity brothers have a positive academic influence on one in three steps. First I would state that fraternity members have resources that unaffilitated students do not have access to, such as annotated notes, annotated slideshows and sample essays. Second I would clarify the myth, stating it is that members of a fraternity get lower grades than those who are unaffiliated. Finally I would provide an alternate explanation, people in fraternities are adventure seeking, and this often makes it appear as though students in fraternities just party all the time when in reality they just get their work done more efficiently due to the increased access of academic tools. 

Using the approach from the truthful art I would create a data visualization  in which a person  has no ground to stand on to support their previous belief. I would use a bar graph with the distribution of non-affiliated students and a column for affiliated students. To support this even further I would use data from the last ten years at centre college. This data would need to clarify the information, by adding all the components that may add clarity to the myth. This should include alcohol consumption, leisure time, and high school gpa of students. Finally I would stay away from bugs. If this data visualtion contracted my own point about the academic benefit of fraternal support, I would drop my own myth and take up this new information I was given by the data visualization.
